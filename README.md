### How to Run
To execute this project, open and run the **Main.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook.

### Project Context
This project was developed using Google Colab (my first experience with it and Jupyter Notebooks) and PyCharm/VS Code.

### Acknowledgments
This work was made possible thanks to the invaluable contributions and resources shared by the community.

### Learning Goals
I approached this project as a learning opportunity, choosing to implement it with PyTorch instead of TensorFlow and focusing on skill development rather than precise replication.
